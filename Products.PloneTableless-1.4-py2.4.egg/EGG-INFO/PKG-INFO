Description: Plone Tableless
        
        Plone Tableless provides a completly tableless version of
        the Plone Default theme, and was created because version 3.0
        does no longer ship with a tableless theme other than NuPlone.
        
        The theme was tested on the following browsers:
        
        * Firefox 2.0 WinXP/Mac OS X
        
        * Camino 1.5.4 Mac OS X
        
        * Safari 3.0.4 Mac OS X
        
        * Opera 9.0 WinXP
        
        * Internet Explorer 6/7 WinXP
