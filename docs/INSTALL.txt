collective.webrichtlijnen Installation
--------------------------------------

Use zc.buildout to install this theme.

* Add ``collective.webrichtlijnen`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        collective.webrichtlijnen
      
* Re-run buildout, e.g. with:

    $ ./bin/buildout

* Start Zope and in your Plone instance:
    - Install collective.webrichtlijnen
        
You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
from another package's configure.zcml file.


Although the theme in this python egg is for Plone 4, here are the install
instructions for Plone 3.

* Add ``collective.webrichtlijnen`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        Products.PloneTableless
        collective.webrichtlijnen

* Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug:

    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    zcml =
        Products.PloneTableless
        collective.webrichtlijnen
        collective.webrichtlijnen-overrides

* Pin down the correct version if you're using Plone 3*

    [versions]
    collective.webrichtlijnen = 1.0.1 # only for Plone 3

* Re-run buildout, e.g. with:

    $ ./bin/buildout

* Start Zope and in your Plone instance:
    - Install Plone Tableless
