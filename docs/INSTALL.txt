Full installation notes
-----------------------

Prefered method for installing this theme is using buildout. 

Plone 4.0 and up
================

* Add ``collective.webrichtlijnen`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        collective.webrichtlijnen
      
* Re-run buildout, e.g. with::

    $ ./bin/buildout

* Start Zope, and in your Plone instance, install `collective.webrichtlijnen`
        
You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
from another package's configure.zcml file.

Plone 3
=======

Although the theme in this python egg is for Plone 4, here are the install
instructions for Plone 3.

* Add ``collective.webrichtlijnen`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        Products.PloneTableless
        collective.webrichtlijnen

* Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::

    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    zcml =
        Products.PloneTableless
        collective.webrichtlijnen
        collective.webrichtlijnen-overrides

* Pin down the correct version if you're using Plone 3*::

    [versions]
    collective.webrichtlijnen = 1.0.2 # only for Plone 3

* Re-run buildout, e.g. with::

    $ ./bin/buildout

* Start Zope, and in your Plone instance install Plone Tableless

Usage with your custom theme
============================

You will probably want to use this product with a custom theme. The recommended
way to do this is to base your theme on `Webrichtlijnen`. That way, the skin
layers will also be available in your theme, without having to register
the skin layer for all themes. Here's an example `skins.xml`::


  <?xml version="1.0"?>

  <object name="portal_skins" allow_any="False" cookie_persistence="False"
     default_skin="My Theme">

   <object name="my_theme_templates"
      meta_type="Filesystem Directory View"
      directory="my.theme:skins/my_theme_templates"/>
   <skin-path name="My Theme" based-on="Webrichtlijnen">
    <layer name="my_theme_templates"
       insert-after="custom"/>
   </skin-path>

  </object>
